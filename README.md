# Braille-Translator
A quick Braille Translator that I created for google foobar challenge 

I was fortunate enough to stumble on the google foobar challenge and it asked me to create a braille translator. Being new to coding I knew that I wouldn't be who google are looking for quite yet, but I wanted to give it a try. I think I created a pretty good project but it wasn't quite what the challenge was looking for. I figured I would post it to my profile.
